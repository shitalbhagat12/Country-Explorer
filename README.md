# Country Explorer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to explore information about different countries. It fetches country data from the REST Countries API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.  Users can search for countries, view details, and filter by region.

## Features

### HTML

* **index.html:** The main page displaying the list of countries. Uses semantic HTML elements like `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and `<figure>` for better structure and accessibility.  Includes a search input and region filter dropdown.
* **details.html:**  Displays detailed information about a selected country.  Includes elements to showcase flags, maps, currencies, languages, and neighboring countries.

### CSS

* **styles.css:**  Styles the main page (index.html). Includes responsive design using media queries.  Implements a card-based layout for displaying country information.
* **details.css:** Styles the details page (details.html).  Focuses on presenting detailed information clearly and logically.

### JavaScript

* **script.js:**  Handles fetching data from the REST Countries API, searching, filtering, and dynamically updating the displayed country list.  Manages user interactions and navigation to the details page.  Implements dark mode toggle functionality.
* **details.js:** Handles fetching and displaying detailed country information on the details page (details.html).  Manages dynamic content updates and potentially handles interactions specific to the details view (e.g., border country navigation).


### API

* **REST Countries API v3:**  Used to fetch country data, including name, population, region, capital, flag, currency, languages, and bordering countries.


## Functionality

1. **Country Listing:** The main page displays a list of countries fetched from the REST Countries API. Each country is displayed as a card with basic information: flag, name, population, region, and capital.
2. **Search:** Users can search for countries by name using the search input. The displayed list is dynamically filtered as the user types.
3. **Filter by Region:**  Users can filter the displayed countries by region using the dropdown menu. The available regions are fetched dynamically from the API.
4. **Country Details:** Clicking on a country card navigates the user to the details page (details.html).
5. **Detailed Information:** The details page displays comprehensive information about the selected country, including:
    * Flag
    * Native Name
    * Population
    * Region
    * Sub Region
    * Capital
    * Top Level Domain
    * Currencies
    * Languages
    * Border Countries (with links to their respective details pages if implemented)
6. **Dark Mode:** The application includes a toggle button to switch between light and dark mode.


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.


## Possible Improvements

* **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading of images to improve initial page load time.
* **Infinite Scrolling:** Implement infinite scrolling for the country list to avoid loading all countries at once.
* **Improved Search:** Enhance the search functionality to handle partial matches and alternative spellings.
* **Offline Caching:** Implement offline caching to allow users to access previously viewed countries even without an internet connection.
* **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests to ensure the reliability of the JavaScript code.
